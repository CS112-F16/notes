CS 112 - Introduction to CS II (using Java)
===========================================

### Welcome to your second-semester computer science class!

The goal of this class is to introduce you to intermediate-level computer science concepts. You will be doing a lot of programming using the Java programming language, but please do not think of this as a Java class. The concepts and problem solving techniques you will learn in this course can be applied using any programming language. Once you understand how to solve problems using programming you should easily be able to pick up another language, like javascript, ruby, rust, or go.

## Java

The Java programming language is an object-oriented language designed to be *portable*.  Unlike languages like C, Java programs follow a "write once, run anywhere" model.  You write the program one time, compile it to byte code, and run it on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) available.
