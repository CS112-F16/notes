Grading Rubric
==============

The rubric that will be used to grade most of your programming assignments is as follows:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Criterion</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Percentage of Points Awarded</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="4"><strong>Solution</strong</td>
		<td align="right">20%</td>
		<td>Code contains some of the required logic but does not compile.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">50%</td>
		<td>All Java files submitted as part of the program compile without error. The program runs and passes some test cases but contains significant logic errors.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">65%</td>
		<td>All Java files submitted as part of the program compile without error. The program runs and passes most test cases but contains a few logic errors. </td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">75%</td>
		<td>All Java files submitted as part of the program compile without error. The program runs, passes all test cases, and no logic errors are found.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="4"><strong>Design</strong></td>
		<td align="right">2.5%</td>
		<td>The code is poorly designed.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">5%</td>
		<td>The code exhibits elements of good design but contains some poorly designed  or inefficient components.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">7.5%</td>
		<td>The code is reasonably well designed with some minor flaws in design or efficiency.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">10%</td>
		<td>The code is well designed and readable.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3"><strong>Style</strong></td>
		<td align="right">2.5%</td>
		<td>The code violates two or more of the <a href="https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/style.md">Style Guidelines</a>.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">5%</td>
		<td>The code violates two or fewer of the <a href="https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/style.md">Style Guidelines</a>.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td align="right">10%</td>

### Code Review
Any student may be asked to come in for code review for any assignment (lab or project). A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a **0** on the assignment in question. A student who is unable to explain his/her code and answer the instructor's questions about his/her code may receive a deduction of up to **100%**, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.

### Examples
Here are some examples to illustrate how this rubric will be applied:

#### Example 1
A program worth 10 total points does not compile but contains some code to implement required logic. The code submitted is reasonably well designed with some design flaws, but follows the style guidelines. 

| Points | Solution | Design | Style | Interface | Total |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | ----- | 
| **Awarded** | 2 | .75 | 1 | 0 | 3.75 | 
| **Maximum** | 7.5 | 1 | 1 | .5 | 10 | 

#### Example 2
A program worth 100 total points compiles and passes almost all test cases. The code submitted is very well designed and follows all style guidelines. The user interface meets the specifications but is somewhat confusing to use.

| Points | Solution | Design | Style | Interface | Total |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | ----- | 
| **Awarded** |65 | 10 | 10 | 2.5 | 87.5 | 
| **Maximum** | 75 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 100 | 

#### Example 3
A program worth 100 total points compiles and passes all test cases. The code submitted is very well designed but is not indented properly, uses poorly chosen variable names, and lacks documentation. The user interface meets the specifications and is natural for the user.

| Points | Solution | Design | Style | Interface | Total |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | ----- | 
| **Awarded** | 75 | 10 | 2.5 | 5 | 92.5 | 
| **Maximum** | 75 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 100 | 

#### Example 4
A program worth 100 total points compiles and passes all test cases. The code submitted is very well designed but is not indented properly, uses poorly chosen variable names, and lacks documentation. The user interface meets the specifications and is natural for the user. The student is **unable** to explain any of his or her code during a required code review.

| Points | Solution | Design | Style | Interface | Deductions | Total |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | ---------- | ----- | 
| **Awarded** | 75 | 10 | 2.5 | 5 | -100 | 0 | 
| **Maximum** | 75 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 100 | 100 |
